#My Raspberry PI IoT Journey

##0. Introduction:
Welcome to my IoT learning journey. This repo will include all the materials that i have used to learn IoT related project 

and where to find those components from.

Some of the components are not going to come cheap but i want to assure you, at the end this journey, it will be worth it.

I learnt a lot particularly new programming languages such as Microsoft C# and MicroPython through out my IoT Journey. To 

you my inspirer and or follower, i say whatever you do during the learning, don't disper and always take every challenge 

with a pitch of salt.
